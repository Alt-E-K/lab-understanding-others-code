# Lab | Understanding others code

## Description
Yesterday you spent some time improving your first week's code. Today we ask you to take someone else's code and understand it.

## Instructions
### You have one hour to...
* Look for the repository of the partner you have been assigned to.
* First, understand the workflow he/she built in their improved version of their code.
* Draw / write the workflow for yourself and note your doubts about it.
* Look for things he/she made that you think could be useful for you.
* Now go to the first version of the code and compare it with the new version. Do you think the improvement is significant?
* Is the git flow useful? Does it clarify some doubts you had?

### Let's give some feedback!
